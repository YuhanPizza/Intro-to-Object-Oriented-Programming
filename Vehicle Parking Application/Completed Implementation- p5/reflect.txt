	In this project I implemented a Parking Program. Implementing it took a total 
of 5 milestones and milestone 5 having multiple parts, I had time to review using a lot
 of what I learned in class.

	During the first milestone, I implemented functions that would serve as the OS/skeleton
of the program and other functions that use iostream's input and output operator. It was a relatively
simple process. But as the Project continued to grow it was harder to keep track of all the functions
I have made but by adding comments to lines it would help me keep track of what certain functions I needed.

	The second milestone used the concept of friend class. And forward declaring Menu class to be added
as a friend class to MenuItem. So that it will have access to Menu Items members. In the third milestone, 
Created class called Vehicles and it was the base class to be used in future milestone for both Motorcycle 
and Car classes. During the 4th milestone we added Write Type function as a pure virtual for Vehicles but is 
defined in the derived classes motorcycle and car classes.

	For the last Milestone we Combined Milestone 2 and Milestone 4 into one cohesive programming and added code
to the incomplete functions in milestone 2. This Milestone was extremely time consuming and tricky for me especialy 
keeping track of all objects, functions etc.. from previous milestone and blend them all together. I think I have 
learned a lot from this semester of OOP244.
