What I have Learned Through This Workshop:

1. Class Privacy 
What is a private class in C++?
The class members declared as private(all class members are private
by default) can be accessed only by the member functions inside the class. 
They are not allowed to be accessed directly by any object or function 
outside the class. Only the member functions are allowed to access the private 
data members of the class.

How is this helpful?
It specifies access level and provides programmers with control over 
which variables and methods are hidden in a class. It prevents those 
members from being altered outside of the member functions. 

2. Format Display Method.
This way of formatting the output of a file helps create a concise and uniform 
format. To make the output look more desirable and understandable. Compared 
to manually spacing it out, this way of formatting files will always uniformly space
them allocate them properly regardless of the length of the variable.
