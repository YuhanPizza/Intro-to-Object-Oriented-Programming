1.Dynamic Memory Allocation
What it is: I learned how to properly allocate memory dynamically from heap; this type of 
memory allocation is allocating memory after the program has ran by requesting 
the operating system to allocate memory from heap;

Dynamic Memory vs Static Memory:
Static Memory is basically hard coding memory in the program this memory allocation does
not change while the program is running; where as Dynamic Memory is allocating memory needed
while the file is running the memory requested from the OS can be changed throughout the 
program.

2. Deallocating Memory
This is clearing the Dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.
This is important because systems have a limited amount of memory and memory is costly.
when you don't deallocate memory the memory usage is always critically increasing. 

3.Overloading functions,
Overloading functions are unique depending on the parameters it accepts when over loading functions
the program will go through all similarly named functions and choose the function which accepts
the needed parameters to implement the function properly; 

4.Passing by reference vs Passing by reference to pointer;
when passing by reference
you are basically using the same variable/object it that object is a pointer and needs proper memory allocation
it does pass the parameter of passing by reference. 
It amazed me how you cant pass a reference of Struct Assessment* a; to a function that only accepts references;
it can only pass by and be implemented by a function that accepts reference to pointers;
