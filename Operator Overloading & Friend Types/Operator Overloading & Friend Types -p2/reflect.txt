Authenticity Decleration:
I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my
professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

What I Learned: 

	1. Operator Overloading
		An overloaded operator is called an operator function, they act as functions that use
	operators when these operator functions are declared in a class they can only be used inside that 
	class unless they are of a friend function type.How they work is you declare an operator 
	function with the keyword operator preceding the operator. Overloaded operators are distinct 
	from overloaded functions, but like overloaded functions, they are distinguished by the number 
	and types of operands used with the operator(unique function signature).


	2. Friend function type
		A friend function is a function that is specified outside a class but has the ability to access 
	the class members' protected and private data. A friend can be a member's function, function template, 
	or function, or a class or class template, in which case the entire class and all of its members are friends.
	You need to put the keyword friend when it is declared inside a class (to give it access to its members) and also 
	redeclare it outside the class.

What I found most challenging:
	
	The scope of this workshop was challenging but due to the research ive done before hand and that ive already learned 
about function overloading the concept was easier to grasp if you approach the overloading operator as a simple overloaded function.
And that friend/helper are functions that can be used to access private class members while also working as a function outside of the 
class.
